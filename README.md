If it is a thin version of the Windows operating system (any non-Microsoft officially released installation 
package may be a lite version of the system). There may be situations where drivers cannot be installed, because 
these systems lack many system driver files. In this case, please re-install your operating system. Be sure to use 
Microsoft's official installation package to install, do not use any ghost version.
